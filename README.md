# cyclistic-bike-share-analysis

I personally made this project in order to complete my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in Coursera. This is a complete case study for data analysis, from asking questions until presenting the analysis results. Files contained on this repository are as follows:
1. Jupyter Notebook used for data cleaning, including explanation of each steps taken.
2. Queries in SQL for cleaned data.
3. Jupyter Notebook used for analysis.

# Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.
The goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
